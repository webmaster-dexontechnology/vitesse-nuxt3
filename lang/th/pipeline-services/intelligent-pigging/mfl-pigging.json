            "title": "How does Magnetic Flux Leakage Work?",
            "subtitle": "MFL ILI PIGs use powerful magnets to magnetize the pipe wall.  Tri axial hall sensors positioned between the magnetic poles then measure flux leakage originating from anomalies.  Anomalies are detected via changes in flux measurements, with the amount of flux leakage determining the precise length, width, and depth of anomalies for identification.  Guaranteeing accurate detection and identification of corrosion, pitting, erosion, lamination, gouging, cracking, and other metal loss anomalies."

            "title": "3D Location Mapping Capabilities",
            "subtitle": "Dexon’s MFL ILI fleet also incorporates XYZ pipeline mapping capabilities providing accurate information on the physical location of the asset in addition to inspection.  Pipelines whether subsea, above ground or underground can be displaced or damaged by numerous natural and man-made forces including ship anchors, landslides, and earthquakes. Pinpoint accurate location data is achieved through the combination and analysis of inertial measurement sensor data (gyroscopic x, y and z orientation data), above ground marker (AGM) data, and PIG travel distance and time stamping data collected during the inspection run. Ask a Dexon Technology expert for more details regarding XYZ pipeline mapping."
