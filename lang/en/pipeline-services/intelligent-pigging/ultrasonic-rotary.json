        "description": "Dexon’s Ultrasonic Rotary (UT-R) in-line inspection Pipeline Integrity Gauges (PIGs) use a rotating reflector to redirect ultrasonic inspection around the pipe circumference. The mechanical rotation offers flexible inspection sampling rates of 1.0mm. UT-R is recommended for pipelines of up to 10 km with a maximum tool speed of 5m/min. UT-R PIGs can detect wall thickness with a measurement accuracy to ±0.3mm. A list of key advantages, usage, detection capabilities, and specification can be seen below. Contact a Dexon Technology expert today for more information concerning Dexon’s in-line inspection services.",
