Furthermore, ultrasonic smart pigging requires sufficient decoking prior to inspection. The Dexon-Scorpion fleet can be utilized to scan process tubes following mechanical decoking to confirm internal cleanliness. If any coke or scale remains, the tool is able to accurately locate and quantify the area of contamination, providing instant feedback to the decoking company, who can then continue the decoking process whilst limiting the focus to the affected tubes/areas. This process ensures that tubes are completely free from any internal fouling, allowing maximum operational efficiency and performance when the furnace returns online. Dexon is available to work in partnership with mechanical decoking service providers, offering a collaborative decoking and inspection service, combining the unique specialties offered by each company."
