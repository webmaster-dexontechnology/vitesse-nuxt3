The ultrasonic sensors are raised towards the pipe wall on mechanical arms, allowing them to extend and contract and maintain close distance with the pipe wall with varying pipe schedules and deformation anomalies.  A list of key advantages, usage, detection capabilities, and specifications can be seen below. Contact a Dexon Technology expert today for more information Dexon’s in-line inspection services."
