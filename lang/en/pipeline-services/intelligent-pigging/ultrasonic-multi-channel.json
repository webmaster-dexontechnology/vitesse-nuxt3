Rows of sensors around the circumference of the tool body record up to 20,000 measurements per second with a sampling density of 1,000,000 samples per square meter. UT-MC offers detection and sizing of internal and external metal loss, deformation, lamination, cracking, and corrosion. Tools are available from 3” up to 64” with larger custom built tool options available. A list of key advantages, usage, detection capabilities, and specifications can be seen below. Contact a Dexon Technology expert today for more information on our in-line inspection services."
