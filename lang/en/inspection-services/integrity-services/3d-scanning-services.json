As-built measurements can accurately determine ovality allowing engineers to plan for asset development. During new product line installation in processing plants, there is new piping and equipment that needs to be installed. With careful planning and the as-built drawings obtained from 3D laser scanning, the new piping designs can be engineered to precisely fit the existing asset, minimizing installation delays due to unforeseen conflicts."
