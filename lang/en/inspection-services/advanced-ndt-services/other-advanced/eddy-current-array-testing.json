The technology can be split up into two main fields of application, Eddy Current Array Surface Testing and Eddy Current Array Tube Testing. The surface applications of ECA technology are numerous, ranging from weld inspection on pressure vessels and pipes to corrosion mapping.",

The array slides on top of surfaces, offering an overall wider coverage and increased sensitivity to defects compared to ECT. The Eddy Current Array technology is able to not only detect surface-breaking defects but to some degree also subsurface defects. ECA probes can even be shaped to match unusual geometries. This allows for single-pass scanning of geometries that are particularly challenging to traditional inspection technologies."

Eddy Current Array’s works particularly well as a supplement to ultrasonic testing (UT) and phased-array UT as both these technologies suffer from shortcomings when it comes to detecting near-surface defects.
