Eddy current probes generate magnetic fields that induce current that flows in a test piece influencing the magnetic field and magnitude and phase of voltage in the coil.",

In addition to crack detection in metal sheets and tubing, eddy current can be used for certain metal thickness measurements and one of its advantages is that surface coatings (up to a certain thickness) do not need to be removed prior to inspection."
