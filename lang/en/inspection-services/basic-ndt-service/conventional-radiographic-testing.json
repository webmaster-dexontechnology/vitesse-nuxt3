        "description": "In radiographic testing (RT), a source of X or gamma radiation is used to produce an image of the component on photographic film (by placing the radiation source on one side of the component and the film on the other). Following exposure to radiation, the film is then processed and then viewed on an illuminated screen for visual interpretation of the image. Radiography gives a permanent record (the exposed film), which is a major advantage of the method, and is widely used to detect volumetric flaws (surface and internal).",

Gamma radiography is carried out using radioactive isotope sources (e.g. Cobalt-60, lridium-192) although its sensitivity is generally less than that achievable by X-ray radiography. lt is widely used for fieldwork because of its greater portability."

An Image Quality Indicator (IQI) is placed on the part so that its image will be produced on the radiograph and a standard for sharpness and contrast can be determined."

Recent advances in technology have allowed for safer radiation sources that are suitable for many RT inspections and Dexon now offers these solutions as the core focus of our RT services."

This allows for lower exposure times and easier image processing. Small Controlled Area Radiography (SCAR) is a safer form of radioactive source that reduces the field of exposure and thus minimizes disruption to other activities."
