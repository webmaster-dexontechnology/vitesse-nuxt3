It is based on energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence technology and the use of X-ray tube. The unit provides a quick field or laboratory method for chemical analysis or sample identification (sorting) directly from metal samples of various forms. It obtains the grade ID of a sample in two to five seconds, with full report in five to 10 seconds. The reports are automatically generated and identify all main element groups.",

The unit is small and portable and ideal for data collection and storage in the field and is operated by only 1 inspector. The accuracy of the PMI unit is +/- 5%. The unit is calibrated by a 3rd party yearly and is accurate for elements including Cr, Ni, Mo, Ti, Cb, Ta, W, Co, V. Approximately 100 locations can be analysed per day. Grinding/preparations of sample surface are required prior to inspection."
